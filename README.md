# 👋 Hi, I'm Apurva

I'm a data analyst who loves turning raw data into real-world impact. Whether it’s building interactive dashboards or training ML models, I’m passionate about using **Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI** to craft stories that drive smarter decisions.

⚡ With a background in consulting and analytics, I thrive at the intersection of **data and business strategy** — where numbers meet narratives.

💡 I believe the best insights are the ones people can actually use. That’s why I enjoy building tools and visualizations that are both **powerful and practical**.
